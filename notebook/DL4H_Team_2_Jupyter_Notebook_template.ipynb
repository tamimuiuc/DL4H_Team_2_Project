        "# Introduction\n",
        "Predicting mortality in sepsis patients is crucial for timely intervention and improved outcomes. Traditional methods often fall short in capturing the complexity of clinical data, leading to suboptimal predictions. Hou et al. (2020) proposed a machine learning approach using the XGBoost algorithm to address this challenge. Their study demonstrates the superiority of XGBoost over traditional methods, providing clinicians with a more accurate tool for identifying high-risk patients and guiding treatment strategies. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and clinical data from the MIMIC-III database, the paper offers a significant advancement in mortality prediction in sepsis patients, with implications for improved patient care and outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Background of the problem\n",

Traditional methods often struggle to capture these complexities accurately, leading to suboptimal predictions.\n",
        "  * the state of the art methods and effectiveness: Traditional methods, including logistic regression and clinical scoring systems, have demonstrated limitations in accurately forecasting mortality in sepsis patients. These conventional approaches often struggle to capture the intricate relationships among various clinical variables and the dynamic nature of the disease process.\n",
        "*   Paper explanation\n",
        "  * what did the paper propose: The paper proposes a binary classification machine learning model based on the XGBoost algorithm for predicting mortality in sepsis patients. It utilizes clinical data from the MIMIC-III database to develop a predictive model that outperforms traditional logistic regression and clinical scoring systems.\n",
        "  * what is the innovations of the method: The innovation lies in the utilization of the XGBoost algorithm, which is a decision-tree-based ensemble learning technique known for its superior performance in predictive tasks. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the proposed method can capture complex patterns in clinical data more effectively, leading to improved mortality predictions.\n",
        "  * how well the proposed method work (in its own metrics): The proposed XGBoost model exhibits remarkable performance, surpassing traditional logistic regression and clinical scoring systems in predicting mortality risk among sepsis patients. The model achieves impressive Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores, with values of 0.857 [95% CI 0.839–0.876] for XGBoost, 0.819 [95% CI 0.800–0.838] for logistic regression, and 0.797 [95% CI 0.781– 0.813] for clinical scoring systems. These metrics underscore the superior discriminatory power of the XGBoost model in distinguishing between survivors and non-survivors.\n",
        "  * what is the contribution to the reasearch regime: The paper significantly contributes to the field of mortality prediction in sepsis patients by introducing a novel binary classification machine learning approach, XGBoost, that outperforms traditional methods. By leveraging advanced techniques and clinical data, the proposed method offers clinicians a more accurate tool for identifying high-risk patients and guiding treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes in ICU settings.\n"

        "Data includes raw data (MIMIC III tables), descriptive statistics (our homework questions), and data processing (feature engineering).\n",
        "  * Source of the data: The data for this project is sourced from the MIMIC-III database, version 1.4. MIMIC-III is a publicly available database that contains de-identified health-related data associated with patients who were admitted to critical care units at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. Access to the MIMIC-III database requires approval from the institutional review board (IRB). This raw data can be found at https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/. Additionally, the raw data used in the study is also provided in the supplemental information of the 'Predicting 30-days mortality for MIMIC-III patients with sepsis-3: a machine learning approach using XGboost' paper. The supplemental information can be found at https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-020-02620-5#Sec14. Once you have the data, you can load it directly to this notebook from the drive.\n",
        "  * Statistics: The dataset consists of 4,559 samples with 106 features, indicating that each sample contains information related to various attributes of sepsis-3 patients. Among these samples, there are 889 instances where patients were deceased within 30 days, while 3,670 patients survived within the same timeframe. Additionally, for model training and testing, we employed a 70/30 split, where 70% of the data (3,191 samples) was allocated for training the machine learning model, and the remaining 30% (1,368 samples) was reserved for testing its performance. This split ensures a sufficient amount of data for both training and evaluating the model's predictive capabilities.\n",
        "  * Data process: To manipulate the data, several preprocessing steps were performed to ensure data quality and suitability for machine learning tasks. Initially, duplicate columns were identified and removed to eliminate redundancy, retaining only the first occurrence of each column. This process resulted in the removal of two duplicate columns from the dataset. Additionally, based on the paper, certain features such as 'urineoutput', 'lactate_min', 'bun_mean', 'sysbp_min','metastatic_cancer', 'inr_max', 'age', 'sodium_max', 'aniongap_max', 'creatinine_min', and 'spo2_mean' were selected as independent features, leaving a total of 11 features for analysis. The 'thirtyday_expire_flag' column was designated as the dependent feature, representing the target label for mortality prediction. Also, for each independent fearture, we replaced the missing values with the mean of the non-missing values. Furthermore, the dataset was split into training and testing sets using a random sampling approach. Random sampling ensures that the distribution of classes in the training and testing sets remains unbiased. Specifically, 70% of the data was allocated for training the machine learning model, while the remaining 30% was set aside for evaluating its performance. This division allows for robust model training on a substantial portion of the data while ensuring an independent evaluation of unseen data to assess generalization ability.\n",

        "The model includes the model definitation which usually is a class, model training, and other necessary parts.\n",
        "  * Model architecture: layer number/size/type, activation function, etc: The XGBoost model is an ensemble of decision trees. In this specific implementation, it consists of 100 decision trees (n_estimators=100) with a maximum depth of 3 (max_depth=3). Each tree is trained using gradient boosting. The learning rate is set to 0.1 (learning_rate=0.1), controlling the contribution of each tree to the final prediction. The Logistic Regression is a linear model with a logistic (sigmoid) activation function. In this implementation, the regularization strength (C) is set to 100, and the penalty term is L1 regularization (penalty='l1'). The solver used to optimize the model parameters is 'liblinear'. The Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training. In this implementation, the number of decision trees in the forest is set to 200 (n_estimators=200). Each tree has a maximum depth of 4 (max_depth=4). The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node is set to 2 (min_samples_split=2), and the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node is set to 4 (min_samples_leaf=4). Additionally, we implemented GridSearchCV for each model locally to fine-tune model parameters. This allowed us to identify the best parameters for each model based on the AUC score, optimizing their performance.\n",
        "  * Training objectives: XGBoost minimizes a loss function that quantifies the difference between the predicted values and the actual target values. The specific loss function used depends on the objective parameter passed to the XGBoost model ('binary:logistic' for binary classification). As this is a binary classification task, the model minimizes the binary logistic loss by default. Logistic Regression minimizes the logistic loss function, also known as the cross-entropy loss, which measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual binary labels. Random Forest minimizes the impurity criterion (e.g., Gini impurity) during tree construction to make splits that lead to the greatest reduction in impurity. The main focus in this section is on ensuring that the models are not underfitted, based on their performance metrics on train set. The XGBoost model exhibits impressive results, with an AUC of 0.893, accuracy of 0.869, precision of 0.851, recall of 0.409, and F1-Score of 0.552. These metrics indicate strong discriminative ability, high overall accuracy, and a good balance between precision and recall, suggesting that the model effectively captures both true positive and true negative cases. Similarly, the Logistic Regression model demonstrates commendable performance, with an AUC of 0.79, accuracy of 0.837, precision of 0.725, recall of 0.277, and F1-Score of 0.4. While the recall is relatively lower compared to the XGBoost model, the other metrics indicate a well-performing classifier. Additionally, the Random Forest model achieves competitive metrics, with an AUC of 0.828, accuracy of 0.84, precision of 0.905, recall of 0.213, and F1-Score of 0.345. Despite a lower recall, the model demonstrates strong discriminative ability and high precision, suggesting effective identification of true positive cases. Overall, these metrics collectively indicate that all models exhibit strong predictive performance without being underfitted, with the XGBoost model standing out as the top performer across multiple metrics.\n",

For model evaluation, we used print_metrics function to display the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model on test data. Based on evaluation results, we obtained the following performance metrics: for the XGBoost model, we achieved an AUC of 0.83, indicating good discriminative ability. The accuracy stood at 0.855. Precision and recall were 0.746 and 0.362, respectively. The F1-Score was 0.487. The confusion matrix revealed 1076 true negatives, 32 false positives, 166 false negatives, and 94 true positives. Similarly, for the Logistic Regression model, we achieved an AUC of 0.787 and an accuracy of 0.841. The precision and recall were 0.702 and 0.281, respectively, resulting in an F1-Score of 0.401. The confusion matrix showed 1077 true negatives, 31 false positives, 187 false negatives, and 73 true positives. Finally, the Random Forest model yielded an AUC of  0.807 and an accuracy of 0.843. Notably, the precision was high at 0.895, but the recall was relatively low at 0.196, leading to an F1-Score of 0.322. The confusion matrix indicated 1102 true negatives, 6 false positives, 209 false negatives, and 51 true positives.\n",
        "*   figures (loss shrinkage, outputs from GAN, annotation or label of sample pictures, etc): In addition to the performance metrics, below, we have included visual representations to further illustrate the results of our experiments. Specifically, we have incorporated figures depicting the AUC curves for each model, offering a graphical depiction of their discriminative ability. Additionally, bar graphs have been included to visually compare the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of all three models. These visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the comparative performance of the XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models in predicting mortality risk in sepsis patients.\n"

        "\n",
        "In this section,you should discuss your work and make future plan. The discussion should address the following questions:\n",
        "  * Make assessment that the paper is reproducible or not:  The paper's results were indeed reproducible, as demonstrated by our closely aligned findings. Our XGBoost model achieved an AUC value of 0.83, which falls within the reported AUC range of [95% CI 0.839–0.876] for XGBoost in the paper. This consistency with the paper's results indicates reproducibility and validates the reliability of the findings. Furthermore, our XGBoost model, developed within this script, outperformed the reported SAPS-II score model [95% CI 0.781–0.813] in the paper, showcasing its superiority in predictive performance. Additionally, when compared to the Logistic Regression model trained in this script, our XGBoost model demonstrated a higher AUC (0.83 vs. 0.787), accuracy (0.855 vs. 0.841), and F1-Score (0.487 vs. 0.401). These results validate Hypothesis 1, suggesting that the ensemble nature of XGBoost aids in capturing complex relationships within the data, resulting in improved predictive performance. Moreover, our XGBoost model exhibited superior performance compared to the Random Forest model, particularly in terms of AUC (0.83 vs. 0.807), accuracy (0.855 vs. 0.843), and F1-Score (0.487 vs. 0.322). This aligns with Hypothesis 2, which proposed that the boosting techniques employed by XGBoost would outperform the bagging techniques utilized by Random Forest in predicting mortality risk in sepsis patients.\n",
        "  * Explain why it is not reproducible if your results are kind negative: Since our results were reproducible and aligned closely with the findings reported in the paper, there are no issues regarding reproducibility in this context.\n",
        "  * Describe “What was easy” and “What was difficult” during the reproduction: During the reproduction process, accessing the dataset and implementing the machine learning model were relatively straightforward tasks. The availability of the MIMIC-III database facilitated easy access to the required data, and the implementation of the XGBoost algorithm was smooth due to the comprehensive documentation available for the library. However, one of the difficulties encountered was related to parameter tuning for the XGBoost model. The absence of detailed information on the specific hyperparameters used in the paper posed a significant challenge during the reproduction process. Without clear guidance on the model's configuration, we were forced to undertake additional experimentation and exploration to optimize the parameters effectively. This unexpected hurdle consumed more time and effort than initially anticipated. Moreover, the lack of code sharing by the authors exacerbated the situation. The unavailability of their codebase prevented us from directly inspecting their implementation details, depriving us of valuable insights that could have expedited our replication efforts.\n",
        "  * Make suggestions to the author or other reproducers on how to improve the reproducibility: To enhance reproducibility, we recommend that authors or other reproducers provide comprehensive details on parameter tuning methodologies. We utilized techniques such as GridSearchCV with scoring='roc_auc_score' to identify the optimal hyperparameters for reproducing the paper's results accurately.\n",
        "  * What will you do in next phase: In the next phase of our project, we will focus on completing the final report and video presentation.
