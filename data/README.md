## Overview
This directory contains processed datasets used in the "Predicting Mortality in Sepsis Patients" project. Due to privacy concerns and the sensitive nature of the original data, we are unable to include the actual MIMIC-III dataset files directly in this repository.

## Accessing the MIMIC-III Dataset
The MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a large, freely-available database.
### Steps to Access:
1. **Training Required**: To access the MIMIC-III data, you must complete the required training course on data privacy through the CITI Program (https://www.citiprogram.org/). This course is necessary to ensure all researchers understand how to handle sensitive health information appropriately.
   
2. **Create a PhysioNet Account**: Register for an account on PhysioNet (https://physionet.org/), the platform hosting the MIMIC-III dataset.
   
3. **Request Access**: After completing the CITI training, you can request access to the dataset by submitting proof of training through your PhysioNet user account. Approval typically takes a few days.

4. **Download the Data**: Once your request is approved, you can download the data directly from the PhysioNet website.

## Supplemental Data Information
The supplemental information of the paper "Predicting 30-days mortality for MIMIC-III patients with sepsis-3: a machine learning approach using XGBoost" includes additional data files that complement the MIMIC-III dataset. These files are helpful for understanding specific aspects of the analysis or for conducting further research. The supplemental information can be accessed at:

## Using the Data in This Project
The data used in this project includes various processed subsets and derived data frames necessary for the analysis presented. Due to the terms of use of the MIMIC-III dataset, these files cannot be shared publicly.
